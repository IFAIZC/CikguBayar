CikguPay – Built for Tuition Teachers

Problem:
Many cikgu tuition/private tutors still rely on manual spreadsheets and WhatsApp to manage student payments. It’s time consuming, messy, and life gets in the way. Some even admitted they forgot to collect payments because they got too busy with classes and admin work.

Solution:
cikguPay was built with love and intention to simplify that process. With just one click, it copies a list of unpaid students directly to the clipboard. Teachers can instantly paste it into their WhatsApp group. No stress, no hunting through spreadsheets.

It's fast, simple, and made to help cikgus focus more on teaching, less on chasing payments. That's CikguPay!

Before I build CikguPay, Here's my validation post.

*Need to talk more about it publicly to create more awareness and to have that validtion that it's worth it to build.
